1. For example you'd like to upload the homework "Counters"

2. So you create on the hosting directory panda/<your name>/hw-2023-06-23/counters

3. Now you go to your React app package.json and add there
   the entry "homepage", like this:

   {
  "name": "counters",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "homepage": "https://panda.knowledger.guru/natalie/hw-2023-06-23/counters",

4. If your app uses react router and starts not from the domain/subdomain

   root, you should to add basename to the BrowserRouter.

   Go to index.js and there add prop "basename" to BrowserRouter,

   like this:

   <BrowserRouter basename="/natalie/hw-2023-06-23/counters">

5. In the terminal:

   $ cd react/counters

   (if there is no node_modules, run "npm i")

   $ npm run build

6. Now you've got directory "build" 

7. Use FTP client like Filezilla and copy the contents of
   your local "build" dir to "counters" dir on the hosting

8. Now check it in the browser at:

https://panda.knowledger.guru/<your name>/hw-2023-06-23/counters
